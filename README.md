# About

This is a documentation of everything Bitcoin Core developer Greg 
Maxwell has ever said on Bitcointalk.org. The documentation will 
eventually be updated to add Maxwell's thoughts on other medium.

There are minor edits to the articles for grammar. All the changes 
are strived to be as minor as possible. All the footnotes included are 
not by the author but by the editor.

For topics that were started by Maxwell, the title of the asciidoc will 
be the title of the topic. However, if the writing is just a comment on 
a topic started by another user, the title will be whatever the editor 
deems sensible with the date attached at the end. 

The editor's version omits the seemingly random thoughts and comments that 
normally happen in a forum. The regular version includes everything that 
Maxwell has ever said.

The final goal is to document all the thoughts that ever happened in the 
Bitcoin development scene. This goal is extremely ambitious and is it 
very uncertain if it will be ever completed.
