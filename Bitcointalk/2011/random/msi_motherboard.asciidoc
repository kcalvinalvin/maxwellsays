You still can't put more than 4 double size cards on it, but 8 PCI-E slots on board?!

*Dayofswords*: >- PCI_E1 supports up to PCIE x16 speed (when PCI_E3 is empty)
- PCI_E2 supports up to PCIE x1 speed
- PCI_E3 supports up to PCIE x8 speed
- PCI_E4 supports up to PCIE x1 speed
- PCI_E5 supports up to PCIE x16 speed (when PCI_E7 is empty)
- PCI_E6 supports up to PCIE x1 speed
- PCI_E7 supports up to PCIE x8 speed
- PCI_E8 supports up to PCIE x1 speed
- If you intend to install two expansion cards, it is recommended to install them into PCI_E1 & PCI_E5 slots.

Dreams, crushed.

*SgtSpike*:Bitcoining only needs PCIe x1.

*grue*: so why pay for a expensive motherboard, when you can get a cheaper one, that has the same amount of pcie x1 slots?

*Maxwell*: So, what boards have 8x PCIe-1x ? slots?  (you can use them via extenders/hacksaw)
