# About

This is a documentation of everything Bitcoin Core developer Greg 
Maxwell has ever said on Bitcointalk.org. The documentation will 
eventually be updated to add Maxwell's thoughts on other medium.

There are minor edits to the articles for grammar. All the changes 
are strived to be as minor as possible. All the footnotes included are 
not by the author but by the editor.

The final goal is to document all the thoughts that ever happened in the 
Bitcoin development scene. This goal is extremely ambitious and is it 
very uncertain if it will be ever completed.
